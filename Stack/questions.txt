1. Implementation of stack using Array/List
2. Implementation of stack using Linkked List
3. Given a string. Remove every consucative dublicate pair of chars until there are no consucative duplicate pair.
   - TC (N) and SC (N)
4. Given two sorted stacks. Merge them into a single sorted stack.
   - TC (N+M) and SC (1) or SC(N+M) ******************* Most Interesting for Space Complexity in case of memory free at time of pop ***********************
5. Given a stack. Sort it.
   - Use Merge Sort
   - TC (NlogN) and SC (logN) - SC due to recursion call if pop release the memory else SC (NlogN)
6.

1. Longest Prefix Sufix(LPS) of string
    - Length of the Longest Prefix which is also a Sufix of the string
    - Note:- Except Whole String
      - Ex:- abcab -> ab (len = 2)
    Solution:
       1. Generate all substring with prefix and sufix and compare
          - TC: O(N^2), SC: O(N^2)
2. LPS Array
3. Given a text (T) and pattern (P)
   - Check if the pattern is present in the text as a substring
4. Given two strings A and B. Check if they two are angrams.
5. Given two strings A and B. Count the number of angrams of B in A as substring.

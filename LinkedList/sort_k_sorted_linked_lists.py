Sort a k sorted doubly linked list

Given a doubly linked list containing n nodes, where each node is at most k away from its target position in the list. The problem is to sort the given doubly linked list. 
For example, let us consider k is 2, a node at position 7 in the sorted doubly linked list, can be at positions 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the given doubly linked list.

Original Doubly linked list:
3 6 2 12 56 8 
Doubly linked list after sorting:
2 3 6 8 12 56
